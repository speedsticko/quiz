  # Examples of quiz questions.
  # All questions have an optional :points => n that determines the
  # number of points the question is worth.  The value is
  # non-normalized, i.e. it's relative only to other questions.  Default
  # is 1 if omitted.

  # This is straight Ruby code, so you can put in expressions, etc.

  # short answer/fill in blanks questions:
  #  - provide a string or regexp to check answer
  #  - a "blank" is three or more hyphens in a row
  #  - all regexps are case-INSENSITIVE unless :case_sensitive => true is passed
  #  - order matters unless :order => false is passed
  #
  # Some restrictions that Coursera places on fill in blank questions right now:
  #  - Only a single blank is allowed
  #  - Correct answers should be included in a single regex and merged by using |
